🌍 Hash Humanity
Hash Humanity is a pioneering social media platform built for the age of artificial intelligence—where authenticity, privacy, and human connection are paramount. It is the first social network in the world to require World ID for authentication, ensuring that every user is a verified, unique human being. No bots. No duplicate accounts. No fake engagement.

🎯 Purpose
In today’s digital landscape, social platforms are increasingly overrun by bots, spam, and AI-generated personas. Hash Humanity was created to reclaim the integrity of online interaction by enforcing a strict one-human-one-account policy using World ID, a privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol.

Our mission is to:

Restore trust in digital communities by eliminating fake accounts and automated content.

Empower real people to engage in meaningful conversations without manipulation or impersonation.

Build a decentralized, human-first social layer for the internet—where identity is verified, but privacy is protected.

Hash Humanity is not just a product—it's a statement: that in the age of synthetic media and algorithmic noise, human presence still matters.

🔐 World ID Integration
Hash Humanity uses World ID as its sole authentication method. Here's how it works:

Biometric Verification via Orb Users verify their identity in person using the Orb, a secure biometric device that scans the iris to generate a unique cryptographic hash (IrisCode). No images are stored, and no personal data is retained.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs World ID uses zero-knowledge proofs to confirm that a user has not registered multiple times—without revealing any biometric or personal information.

Local Identity Storage Once verified, the user’s World ID is stored locally on their device via the World App. Hash Humanity accesses this credential to authenticate users securely.

One Human, One Account This system guarantees that each account belongs to a single, verified human—making Hash Humanity the first platform to achieve true digital personhood at scale.

⚙️ Technology Stack
